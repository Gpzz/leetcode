# leetcode

Leetcode is a website containing various tasks designed to test both coding skills and problem solving.

The problems are found here: https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/

My solution filenames correspond to the problem they solve. I have chosen a selection of problems designed to target multiple topics such as: arrays, hashmaps, stacks, backtracking, search, trees, linked lists, graphs & dynamic programming.

I plan to build on this repository slowly over time as a showcase of my approach to problem solving.
